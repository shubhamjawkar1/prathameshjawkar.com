step 2:
Great! Your website is now live and working at https://prathameshjawkar-com.pages.dev/. I can see it's displaying Prathamesh Jawkar's archery portfolio beautifully.

Regarding the custom domain HTTPS issue, yes, you're absolutely right! The problem is likely because you have your domain's nameservers pointing to a free hosting service instead of Cloudflare.

Here's what's happening:

1. Your domain nameservers are pointing to the free hosting service
2. Cloudflare can't manage SSL certificates because it doesn't control your domain's DNS
3. HTTPS won't work until Cloudflare can manage your domain's DNS

Solution: Change Nameservers to Cloudflare

Step 1: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare (if not already done)
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Click "Add site"
3. Enter your domain: prathameshjawkar.com
4. Choose the Free plan
5. Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records

Step 2: Get Cloudflare Nameservers
After adding your domain, Cloudflare will show you nameservers like:
•  alice.ns.cloudflare.com
•  bob.ns.cloudflare.com

Step 3: Update Nameservers in GoDaddy
1. Log into GoDaddy
2. Go to Domain Manager
3. Find your domain prathameshjawkar.com
4. Click "Manage DNS" or "Nameservers"
5. Change from "Default" to "Custom"
6. Replace the current nameservers with Cloudflare's nameservers
7. Save changes

Step 4: Configure DNS in Cloudflare
Once nameservers are updated:
1. In Cloudflare DNS settings, add a CNAME record:
•  Name: @ (or your subdomain like www)
•  Target: prathameshjawkar-com.pages.dev
•  Proxy status: ✅ Proxied (orange cloud)

Step 5: Connect Custom Domain in Pages
1. Go to your Pages project in Cloudflare
2. Settings → Custom domains
3. Add custom domain: prathameshjawkar.com
4. Cloudflare will automatically handle the SSL certificate

Timeline:
•  Nameserver change: 24-48 hours to fully propagate
•  SSL certificate: Usually issued within 15 minutes after nameservers are active

Alternative (Quick Fix):
If you want to keep your current hosting setup, you could:
1. Use a subdomain like portfolio.prathameshjawkar.com
2. Point just that subdomain to Cloudflare Pages using a CNAME record
3. Keep your main domain on the free hosting
